## What is Sukarix?

Sukarix is an open-source PHP framework built on top of the Fat-Free Framework (F3) designed to create enterprise-grade
web and server/CLI applications. The name "Sukarix" is derived from the Arabic word "سُكَّر" (sukkar), which means
sugar, symbolizing the framework's goal to add sweetness and efficiency to the robust and lightweight Fat-Free
Framework.

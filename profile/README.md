## What is Sukarix?

Sukarix is an open-source **PHP application framework** built on top of the Fat-Free Framework (F3) designed to create
**enterprise-grade** web and server/CLI applications. The name "Sukarix" is derived from the Arabic word "سُكَّر" (
sukkar), which means sugar, symbolizing the framework's goal to add sweetness and efficiency to the robust and
lightweight Fat-Free Framework.
